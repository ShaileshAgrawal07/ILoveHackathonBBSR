EchoAssist: Bridging Communication Gaps with Real-Time Translation

EchoAssist is an innovative web application designed to enable seamless communication for speech and hearing-impaired individuals across different languages. It integrates advanced technologies like speech recognition, synthesis, AI/ML and Blockchain Concepts; to provide a secure, decentralized, and efficient translation solution.

The application converts speech to text and vice versa, supporting real-time multilingual translation using AI models such as BERT for natural language processing. For users familiar with sign language, EchoAssist offers AR-based animated hand sign overlays, ensuring inclusive communication. This feature extends to illiterate users by enhancing comprehension through visual aids.

Blockchain technology ensures privacy and transparency by securely managing multilingual datasets, incorporating Proof of Work (PoW) for decentralized authentication. WebRTC facilitates real-time audio and video communication, enabling live interactions and supporting scenarios like interviews for speech-impaired candidates.

EchoAssist prioritizes accessibility, offering online and offline functionalities through preloaded datasets for basic conversations. Its versatile design caters to a wide range of use cases, including recruitment processes, doctor-patient communication, and government engagement with laborers and farmers.

By breaking communication barriers, EchoAssist fosters social inclusion, boosts confidence, and transforms interactions for impaired individuals, creating a more inclusive and equitable world.

Hackathons are a great way to bring ideas to life, and this project provides the tools, templates, and resources to make your hackathon journey smooth and impactful.
